# IMA-201: Introduction to image processing
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course IMA-201 at Télécom Paris.

This course covers the foundations of digital image processing and analysis:
- Acquisition pipeline and digital photography devices (optics, sampling, noise, radiometry, color)
- Restoration and image improvement (denoising, inverse problems and deconvolution, super-resolution, inpainting, etc.) 
- Image analysis (differential operators, segmentation, local descriptors, texture, shape representation),

and offers  Mathematical tools for image representations, at different scales:
- Multi-scale Gaussian and Laplacian representations
- Wavelets
- Discrete representations
- Mathematical morphology

Examples in various fields are given, and  the course is complemented by lab  work in image processing.
